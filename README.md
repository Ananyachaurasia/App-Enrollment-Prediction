#  FineTech – App Enrollment Prediction using Machine Learning

FineTech is an advanced AI-driven Machine Learning web application built to predict the likelihood of a user enrolling in a financial technology platform. By intelligently analyzing a combination of demographic attributes, financial account indicators, and in-app behavioral interactions, FineTech generates accurate enrollment probability scores. This enables businesses to gain deeper user insights, optimize engagement strategies, and make data-informed decisions to improve customer acquisition and retention.

#  Project Overview

FineTech helps financial platforms understand user intent by evaluating:

- User profile attributes (age, time of app usage)
- Financial product ownership (savings, credit cards, loans)
- In-app engagement patterns (screens viewed, premium usage)
- Advanced screen navigation behavior

The system outputs:

✅ Enrollment likelihood  
✅ Probability score

## Results

Using the **Logistic Regression** model, we achieved an accuracy of approximately **77%** in predicting user enrollment behavior.

This demonstrates that the model is able to effectively distinguish between users who are likely to subscribe and those who may require additional marketing efforts or promotional offers.
